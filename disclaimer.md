Common Lisp's CLOS is a very powerful object system. While SOLID principles can and often be helpful in other languages, it carries little benefits in Lisp. However, we will demonstrate an idiomatic Lisp alternative of every SOLID principles, with multi-method (multiple dispatch) and protocol approaches. We will show you why Lisp approaches are better (in Lisp) and why problems that SOLID principles are trying to solve in other languages, almost disappears in Lisp with the existence of CLOS.

We are going to use two different programming languages for this book code examples.
