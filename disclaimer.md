These principles are not rules. Apply them where you think it does make sense. Don't "over-engineer".

We are going to focus on Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion principles where they makes the most sense to apply with Common Lisp as a dynamic typed language.
