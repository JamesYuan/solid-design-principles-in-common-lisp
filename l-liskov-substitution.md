# L: Liskov Substitution

###### Let _Φ\(x\) be a property provable about objects x of type T_. Then _Φ\(y\) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T._

##### in other words: Likov's Substitution Principle states that if a program module is using a Base class, then the reference to the Base class can be replaced with a Derived class without affecting the functionality of the program module.
